# El Capitan v0.1.0 technical preview release notes

**Status:** unreleased; external release gates remain blocked

## Important limitations

- This is a self-hosted technical preview, not an autonomous replacement for a
  DevOps or SRE team and not a public multi-tenant SaaS.
- Read-only live validation covers 72 deterministic controls (35 Azure, 37 AWS),
  but only four controls support verified remediation planning and only three
  controls have action connectors: two E2E-measured Azure Storage paths and one
  contract-tested, not-yet-executed AWS S3 path.
- Validation capability never grants planning or execution authority.
- Shared-token browser authentication is for local demonstration and bounded
  pilots, not production customer approval.
- Azure OpenAI and Cosmos DB controls are contract tested and export observed,
  not E2E measured. Key Vault diagnostic logging, the six added S3 controls,
  eight RDS controls, twenty EC2 security-group controls, and two EBS volume
  controls are contract tested but not yet measured in the lab.
- No unattended production remediation, generic VM/OS patching, arbitrary
  application-code remediation, broad AWS execution, or complete benchmark
  coverage is claimed.

## What is included

- OCSF and AWS Security Hub ASFF intake with exact FAIL/PASS/MANUAL accounting,
  replay deduplication, tenant isolation, correlation, transparent priority,
  and optional exact-resource asset-context enrichment with a no-write match
  and gap preview.
- Authenticated read-only fleet console with explicit source, outcome,
  validation, planning, execution, and evidence-grade labels; guided sample and
  scanner-export entry paths; and a no-write import preview before confirmation.
- Bounded Azure and AWS collectors with minimized typed evidence and
  deterministic fail-closed evaluation.
- Conservative Terraform or AWS CDK/CloudFormation linkage, isolated
  complete-file proposals, and engine-specific format, synthesis, validation,
  and exact-scope checks.
- Independent SRE, change-window, rollback, human-decision, execution,
  verification, certificate, and originator-handoff records.
- Durable runtime budgets, idempotent replay, equivalent-failure circuit
  breaking, and operator-visible needs-human outcomes.
- Docker Compose quickstart with PostgreSQL and a checked-in synthetic finding.
- Generated capability/evidence matrix, pinned container inputs, package and
  container security checks, CycloneDX SBOM, provenance, and guarded release
  automation.

## Local preview

```bash
docker compose up --build --detach --wait
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8770` and follow the [five-minute
quickstart](quickstart.md). It uses synthetic data and needs no cloud or model
credentials.

## Candidate evidence

The local clean-clone rehearsal at commit `44dd79e` passed 538 tests, inspected
the wheel and source distribution, ran the complete-history secret prevention
scan with its disclosed historical baseline, completed the authenticated
PostgreSQL quickstart, generated a 370-component CycloneDX container SBOM, and
recorded local OCI provenance. See the [dated rehearsal
record](release-rehearsal-2026-08-28.md).

The AWS parity checkpoint was built from source commit
`499382d278afee8f750af74b8e879bd1cfbd8c2c`. It passes 680 tests, package and
installed-wheel smoke checks, capability-matrix and release-tree checks,
narrow Ruff checks, and `git diff --check`. No AWS execution, cloud write,
model call, customer-system access, or external publication was performed.

The subsequent EBS volume checkpoint was built from source commit
`f441de9ecaa8d947a24e33acbd4b5e000c46bd88`. It passes 703 tests, compile and
narrow Ruff checks, generated-matrix and release-tree verification,
wheel/source builds, distribution inspection, and `git diff --check`. It used
only synthetic AWS contract fixtures and made no cloud or model call.

The Guided Shadow Trial working-tree checkpoint builds from committed EBS base
`7e2b0b4`. It adds a no-write/no-cloud intake preview, guided first-use paths,
plain-language results, exact-resource asset context, and score-driving
observation detail without adding approval, scheduling, model, or execution
routes. Its realistic Azure test acceptance is recorded in
[`azure-asset-context-trial-2026-09-01.md`](azure-asset-context-trial-2026-09-01.md).

The AWS S3 evidence-to-review checkpoint is preserved in `a736e5b`. It passes
725 tests and the compile, narrow Ruff, generated-matrix, release-tree,
wheel/source build, distribution-inspection, locked-requirements, and diff
checks. It uses only recorded contract fixtures and grants no AWS execution
authority.

The subsequent AWS CDK/CloudFormation action checkpoint adds a digest-bound S3
versioning connector, isolated exact-role executor credentials, control-plane
monitoring, post-change validation, and honest irreversible-change containment.
Its full local verification result is recorded in the current handoff. No AWS
write was performed; the first production package remains subject to a fresh
digest-bound approval.

The public runtime, CI, and release workflow use pinned Terraform 1.16.1. The
upgrade replaces Terraform 1.16.0's fixed-high vulnerable embedded gRPC-Go with
upstream's patched gRPC-Go 1.83.1; the rebuilt non-root image passes fresh
Trivy 0.70.0 high/critical scanning locally.

This evidence is not release approval. GitHub Support confirmed retained
PR-ref cleanup on 2026-09-03; the repository is now public, and the protected
`release` environment requires reviewer `kkmookhey`. Before the version is
tagged, a committed digest-bound release approval must authorize the exact tag.
The changelog date and release artifacts must then be regenerated for that tag.
