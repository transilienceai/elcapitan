# Customer shadow-run guide

For environment selection and the CTO access request, start with the
[first customer pilot profile](first-customer-pilot.md).

The customer shadow fleet is the first real-environment entry point for El
Capitan. It answers four questions before any remediation authority exists:

1. Which scanner findings are still true in live cloud configuration?
2. Which controls does El Capitan understand deterministically?
3. What is the transparent risk order across the customer portfolio?
4. Which validated cases are ready to enter the separately controlled
   planning and human-review plane?

## Hard boundary

`serve-shadow` exposes no-write intake preview, confirmed finding intake, fleet
inventory, connector readiness, case evidence, single-case validation, and
bounded batch validation. Preview uses the same normalization, source-identity,
schema, and priority checks as intake, then removes its temporary evidence. It
makes no cloud or model request and performs no persistent product write. The
service has no approval, schedule, deployment, rollback, or model endpoint.
Its policy object cannot be constructed with any of those action permissions
enabled. Do not attach an executor identity, Contributor role, model API key,
or customer write credential to this service.

The first customer run should use a dedicated deployment and database. Do not
reuse the public synthetic lifecycle demo's `/data` volume or cloud identity.

## Supported live validation

Support is explicit and fails closed:

Definitions are installed through the
[control-pack architecture](control-packs.md); the fleet workflow remains
provider-neutral while each service retains its exact evidence semantics.

The SQL control reads the server encryption protector, every page of the
database inventory, and the TDE state of every user database. The immutable
`master` database is excluded to match Azure and current Prowler semantics.
Incomplete, denied, malformed, or out-of-scope reads block validation rather
than producing a partial result.

The seven S3 controls reuse one bounded bucket-state capture. The six newer
controls are contract tested; only object versioning currently carries an
E2E-measured validation grade plus planning and separately gated execution
capability. Its Terraform route admits one state-grounded
`versioning_configuration[0].status` transition. Its CDK route admits one
deployed-template-grounded `VersioningConfiguration.Status` transition and
persists exact forward/containment artifacts. The connector is contract tested;
no production AWS execution has been measured, and recovery from a first
enable is honestly recorded as containment rather than exact rollback.

The eight RDS controls use one `DescribeDBInstances` call scoped to the exact
DB-instance ARN and its ARN-derived region. They are contract tested and
validation-only. The response must contain exactly that one instance; denied,
missing, multiple, mismatched, paginated, DocumentDB, and malformed responses
remain unavailable evidence rather than inferred configuration.

The twenty EC2 security-group controls use one exact-ID group read plus one
group-filtered attachment read capped after the first result. They validate
public port and CIDR exposure, default and Launch Wizard groups, and excessive
permission-entry counts. Prowler's unused-group exclusion and duplicate
all-port/specific-port suppression remain explicit. Both reads are required;
denied, absent, mismatched, partial-empty, and malformed responses fail closed.

The two EBS volume controls use one exact-ID volume read plus one owner-`self`,
volume-filtered snapshot read capped after the first result. They retain only
whether the volume is encrypted and whether an owned snapshot exists. Both are
contract tested and validation-only. A denied, absent, multiple, mismatched,
malformed, or empty-partial response remains unavailable evidence.

An unknown provider rejects the entire intake batch before persistence. An
unknown rule may be retained in the portfolio for coverage reporting, but the
validator makes no cloud request and does not infer its status.

Several controls on one resource correlate into one case. When such a case
contains both supported and unsupported controls, live validation evaluates
the supported subset and records every unsupported sibling explicitly. One or
more live-confirmed controls may advance the case to validated; promotion is
bound only to the exact confirmed finding and evidence set. A case containing
no supported control is rejected before any cloud request, and a case with no
confirmation plus unavailable or unsupported evidence remains blocked.

## Identity contract

Use a dedicated read-only scanner identity. Ambient AWS and Azure CLI sessions
are not eligible. Azure Container Apps should use a user-assigned managed
identity and supply its client ID:

```text
ELCAP_SCANNER_AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID
```

The platform-provided `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT` and `IDENTITY_HEADER` complete that
credential-free flow. The validator requests an ARM token from the local
identity endpoint and calls only read operations. For local development or a
non-Azure host, the explicit service-principal fallback is:

```text
ELCAP_SCANNER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
ELCAP_SCANNER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
ELCAP_SCANNER_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

ELCAP_SCANNER_AZURE_CLIENT_ID
ELCAP_SCANNER_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
ELCAP_SCANNER_AZURE_TENANT_ID
```

AWS should use a short-lived session and least-privilege read actions for the
resource types being validated. Azure should use a managed identity with Reader
limited to the in-scope resource groups; never mix the managed-identity and
service-principal variables. Keep the scanner identity distinct from the
observer used for historical metrics and from any future execution worker.

Before ingestion, verify local prerequisites without making a cloud request:

```bash
uv run elcapitan connector-preflight --provider azure
uv run elcapitan connector-preflight --provider aws
uv run elcapitan capabilities
```

## Safe run sequence

Before any upload or connector access, run the same intake and prioritization
policy entirely locally:

```bash
uv run elcapitan shadow-offline-report /path/to/prowler.ocsf.json \
  --tenant CUSTOMER-OFFLINE \
  --workdir /private/tmp/elcapitan-customer-shadow/work \
  --json-output /private/tmp/elcapitan-customer-shadow/portfolio.json \
  --markdown-output /private/tmp/elcapitan-customer-shadow/summary.md
```

The command starts with an empty local shadow store, accepts only explicit
Prowler `FAIL` records, and writes both outputs with mode `0600`. It makes no
cloud or model request. The JSON contains every resource case and deterministic
risk factor; the Markdown summary highlights intake accounting, control
coverage, and the bounded live-validation candidates. Its ordering is labeled
scanner-evidence provisional until customer asset criticality, ownership,
dependencies, exploitability, and business impact are supplied.

1. Create a customer-specific tenant identifier that contains no secret or
   personal data.
2. Export findings from the scanner. Keep the source export unchanged for
   chain-of-custody purposes.
3. Prepare an optional asset-context JSON manifest using
   [`asset-context-manifest.example.json`](asset-context-manifest.example.json).
   Use exact cloud resource IDs and identify the owner, environment,
   criticality, services, context source, and evidence references. Mark trial
   assignments synthetic. Do not infer reachability merely from a public
   endpoint.
4. Start `serve-shadow` with a fresh 24+ character access token, a dedicated
   work directory, and `ELCAPITAN_DATABASE_URL` set to a TLS-required PostgreSQL
   connection string.
5. Preview a small representative batch first. Confirm format, provider,
   FAIL/PASS/MANUAL accounting, resource and account counts, and the supported
   versus unsupported split. When a manifest is supplied, also confirm matched
   resources, findings without context, inventory rows without findings,
   critical resources, and observed internet exposure before choosing **Import
   findings**. Preview does not retain the export or contact the customer cloud.
6. After import, confirm account, resource identifier, rule mapping, risk
   factors, and supported/unsupported counts in the result drill-down.
7. Confirm connector readiness. If it is offline, resolve the missing binary or
   named environment variables; do not substitute a broader credential.
8. Check one non-production or low-risk finding, inspect its evidence record,
   then use the enabled **Check N ready** action for batches of at most 100
   resources. When no connector-backed resource can run, the disabled action
   reads **No cloud checks ready**.
9. Export or review the resulting prioritized fleet. Cases in `validated` are
   candidates for the existing `prepare-review` workflow; cases in
   `closed_no_action` are stale or already resolved, and `blocked` cases require
   evidence or control support.

Batch validation resolves every case's tenant ownership, state, rule support,
and connector readiness before the first cloud request. It remains possible
for a cloud read to fail after preflight; that failure is retained as restricted
evidence and the affected case fails closed.

Prowler exports may contain `PASS`, `FAIL`, and `MANUAL` records together.
El Capitan treats only an explicit `status_code == "FAIL"` as an actionable
finding. It reports and skips `PASS` and `MANUAL`; it never infers the result
from OCSF `status` or `severity`. `status` is commonly `New` for every check,
and a passing control retains that control's configured severity. Missing or
unknown Prowler outcomes reject the batch before durable writes.

Prowler 5.x may also reuse `finding_info.uid` for the same check on different
resources. Intake therefore binds Prowler idempotency to the producer UID,
rule ID, and resource UID together. The original UID remains preserved in the
normalized evidence record; replaying one check/resource observation remains
idempotent without collapsing distinct resources.

Asset context is a separate input from scanner and threat context. A matched
row supplies per-resource criticality, ownership, service, environment,
exposure, runtime-dependency, and compensating-control signals. Exploit
probability, known exploitation, and active exploitation remain finding-level
signals; they must not be copied into an asset inventory merely to raise a
score. Each stored context row includes a canonical SHA-256 digest, source,
timestamp, evidence references, and an explicit synthetic-business-context
flag. Unknown exposure remains unknown and falls back to explicit scanner
categories; it is not converted to internal by absence.

When several findings share one resource, the resource case uses the highest
independent finding score; it does not sum finding scores. The result
drill-down identifies that score-driving observation and lists the other
grouped observations with their own scores. The case-level factors and evidence
references also come only from that score-driving observation; lower-scoring
findings remain visible but do not contaminate the score explanation.

## Data handling

When `ELCAPITAN_DATABASE_URL` is present, cases, events, findings, product
records, and immutable evidence blobs are stored in PostgreSQL. Evidence is
rehydrated into the container's private working directory at startup and every
blob is checked against its persisted SHA-256 digest. Reusing an artifact path
with different content fails closed. SQLite and local files remain the local,
single-node fallback when the database variable is absent.

The shadow service sends nothing to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or any other
model provider. `/healthz` is anonymous for the hosting platform and performs
a real database query; all dashboard assets and case APIs require the access
token. Browser sessions use an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie, and
cross-origin writes are rejected.

The Azure reference deployment uses a VNet-integrated Container Apps
environment and PostgreSQL Flexible Server with public network access disabled,
TLS required, seven-day backups, and a database-scoped application credential.
The checked-in `deploy/azure/shadow-app.yaml` deliberately defaults to internal
ingress. Enable HTTPS-only external ingress only after database health,
anonymous denial, and authenticated UI/API checks pass.

The guarded lab bootstrap is split into explicit phases under `deploy/azure`.
`bootstrap-shadow-database.sh` creates or rotates one non-privileged login and
an application-owned schema through a temporary no-ingress job, deletes that
job and its secrets, and reseals the server administrator. The scoped password
is handed to `create-customer-shadow-app.sh` through macOS Keychain and removed
after the internal app is created. `repair-customer-shadow-database.sh` is the
fail-closed recovery path when a scoped password or immutable image must be
rebound; it deliberately retains the Keychain handoff until health is proven.
All three scripts pin the El Capitan lab subscription and refuse an unconfirmed
operation. The bootstrap, create, and repair scripts also require
`ELCAPITAN_LAB_IMAGE` to name an immutable image digest in the pinned lab ACR.
The create script additionally requires `ELCAPITAN_LAB_SCANNER_ID` and
`ELCAPITAN_LAB_SCANNER_CLIENT_ID`; it accepts only the dedicated
`elcapitan-<slug>-scanner` identity in the pinned resource group and attaches it
separately from the image-pull identity. They are reference automation, not
authorization to use a customer subscription.

For a real customer, put Entra ID, an identity-aware proxy, or equivalent SSO
in front of the app, use customer-controlled encryption and retention, and
centralize audit logs. The access-token boundary is appropriate for this
non-production demo, not the final customer authentication design.

## Promotion to human review

Promotion is deliberately a separate deployment boundary. The planning worker
requires a read-only customer IaC checkout or repository snapshot, optional
Terraform state JSON for computed resource mapping, explicit service ownership
and health signals, and historical usage samples. Run `prepare-review` only for
a confirmed case. It works in an isolated copy, never runs `terraform apply`,
and stops at `awaiting_approval` after Terraform checks, SRE review, window
selection, and independent rollback review all pass.

Export the current evidence-minimized handoff first:

```bash
uv run elcapitan promotion-manifest \
  --tenant TENANT --case CASE-... --db /path/to/product.db
```

Pass its `promotion_token` to `prepare-review --promotion-token`. The token is
derived from the exact case, confirmed finding set, target resource,
validation record, and validation evidence references. It is not a bearer
credential and grants no cloud access; it is a tamper/TOCTOU guard. A changed
or incomplete validation boundary is rejected before model dispatch or
Terraform work.

For a mixed resource case, the handoff is intentionally narrower than the
scanner case: it selects only findings that are both live-confirmed and marked
planning-capable in the registry. Every unsupported, unavailable, cleared, or
confirmed-but-unplannable sibling is returned as excluded scope. The planning
worker receives the selected finding IDs and persists them in the plan record;
it must not silently expand back to every scanner observation on the resource.

Do not give the shadow web service those repository, model, observer, or
execution credentials. That separation is an intentional product control, not
a temporary UI omission.

For AWS S3 planning, the isolated planning worker accepts only a complete,
separate short-lived session:

```text
ELCAP_PLANNER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
ELCAP_PLANNER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
ELCAP_PLANNER_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

It does not inherit `AWS_PROFILE`, shared credential files, scanner variables,
or Azure planner identity. State is used ephemerally; the durable record retains
only the exact Terraform address and state digest. The plan file is inspected
for scope and then discarded. `terraform apply` is never invoked.
